            My attitude towards my future can be summed up in one solitary quote by Mr. Frank Lloyd Wright.
It reads, “I know the price of success: dedication, hard-work, and an unremitting devotion to the
things I want to see happen.” In any endeavor I choose to partake in, whether it is work or personal
related, I strive to uphold this philosophy.
